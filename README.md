# BAMCIS GeoJSON
An implementation of GeoJSON written in .NET Core 2.0. The library complies with the requirements of RFC 7946 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946). Can be found on nuget https://www.nuget.org/packages/geojson.

## Limitations

The library does not support section 6 of RFC 7946, extending GeoJSON with Foreign Members. You would need to extend the existing Geometries, Feature, and FeatureCollection classes with the additional properties included in the serialized JSON.

## Usage

### Example 1

Given some GeoJSON data, such as:

    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [ 102.0, 0.5 ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "prop0": "value0"
      }
    }

You can receive the text and deserialize it to a GeoJSON object

    GeoJson data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<GeoJson>(jsonString);

Once the data is deserialized, you can cast it to its actual type

    switch (data.Type)
    {
        case GeoJsonType.Feature:
        {
            Feature feature = (Feature)data;
            break;
        }
        ...
    }

### Example 2
If you know what kind of GeoJSON you're receiving, you can deserialize to it directly:

    FeatureCollection Col = FeatureCollection.FromJson(data);

And also go back to JSON data:

    string Json = Col.ToJson(Formatting.Idented);

### Example 3

Or you can create a GeoJSON object and serialize it:

    Position Pos1 = new Position(100.0, 0.5);
	Position Pos2 = new Position(101.0, 1.0);
	MultiPoint Mp = new MultiPoint(new Position[] {Pos1, Pos2});
	string Json = JsonConvert.Serialize(Mp);

### Usage Notes

Each of the 9 GeoJSON types: **Feature**, **FeatureCollection**, **GeometryCollection**, **LineString**, **MultiLineString**, **MultiPoint**, **MultiPolygon**,
**Point**, and **Polygon** all have convenience methods ToJson() and FromJson() to make serialization and deserialization easy.

There are two additional types that can be used. A **LinearRing** is a LineString that is connected as the start and end and forms
the basis of a polygon. You can also use the abstract **Geometry** class that encompasses LineString, MultiLineString, MultiPoint, MultiPolygon,
Point, and Polygon.

The Feature **'Properties'** property implements an `IDictionary<string, dynamic>` in order to accomodate any type of property structure that may 
be sent.

## Revision History

### 2.0.0
Changed JSON serialized property names to proper camel case by default to be RFC compliant. Added strong-named assembly signing.

### 1.2.1
Fixed sequence comparison null value handling.

### 1.2.0
Enabled the use of the bounding box property on all GeoJSON types.

### 1.1.2
Actually fixed targeting `netstandard1.6` instead of v1.6.1.

### 1.1.1
Fixed targetting of netstandard1.6, dropped JSON.NET to 9.0.1. Added `netstandard2.0` and `net45` as target frameworks.

### 1.1.0
Retargetted library to netstandard1.6.

### 1.0.0
Initial release of the library.
